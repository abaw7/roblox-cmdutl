Plugin Buttons:

CmdUtl Panel
	Toggles the display of the GUI panel.

	Click & hold the border of the panel to drag it around.
	The panel will snap to the screen's edge and other certain objects.
	The panel also collapses into whichever side it's snapped to when the mouse isn't hovered over it, and a tool isn't selected.

	Inside the panel are menus, which hold various tools.
	The colored bar on top of each menu can be dragged to rearrange the menus in the panel.
	If this bar is clicked, but not dragged, the menu will collapse or expand.

	Right above the panel is an info box, which displays results of actions made from tools.
	This can be dragged as well, and snaps just like the panel.
