CmdUtl (more specifically, the script) is built with the "MAKE.lua" file.
MAKE.lua runs another lua file called "makefile.lua", which is located in the working directory.
makefile.lua contains the specific build instructions.

All you really need to do is run MAKE.lua with makefile.lua in the working directory.
MAKE.lua is compatible with versions 5.1 and 5.2.

Here's an example in Windows:
	1) Download the Lua binary corresponding to your version of Windows:
		32-bit:
			http://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/files/5.2/Executables/lua-5.2_Win32_bin.zip/download
		64-bit:
			http://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/files/5.2/Executables/lua-5.2_Win64_bin.zip/download
	2) Unzip to the same directory as MAKE.lua
	3) Open command prompt in the same directory
	4) Do "Lua52 MAKE.lua"
	5) Check for warnings. If it says "Done (0 warnings)", then the build was sucessful
	6) The results of the build (CmdUtl.lua) will be located in build/CmdUtl/
